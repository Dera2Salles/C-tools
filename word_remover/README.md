# Word Remover

A tool to remove all occurrences of a specific word from a file or all files in a directory.

## Usage
```bash
./word_remover <file_or_directory> <word_to_remove>
```
Recursively processes files (non-recursive for directories themselves, but processes all regular files within) to remove the target word.
